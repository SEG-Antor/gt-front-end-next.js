                    <p>I got one phone, and then decided that I wanted a different one so - I have ordered, returned, gotten refunded and ordered anew with these people. And I have to say it was all seamless. I love the goal of creating less electronica waste by reusing it, and the phone that I have now works great.</p>

                    <p>This was my second phone that I got from trade. The phone was described accurate and arrived quickly. No issues at all.</p>

                    <p>As always the iphone does not disappoint. It is a bit expensive, but the user experience is really to notch. It feels very well made, and I have enjoyed using it so far. Battery life is excellent, the screen is beautiful, and while I haven&apos;t taken many photos yet, the cameras seem great, especially the selfie camera.</p>

                    <p>Loving my phone! At the moment I&apos;m needing to take photos and videos for a project and the quality is superb. It looks as if I&apos;m still standing in the scene. Battery can sometimes last me two days even if I&apos;ve been steaming video.</p>
